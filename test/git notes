don't code when on master

don't code on the same files as anyone else
    can cause merge conflicts

if you MUST work in the same file, work in different blocks to make it easier to merge.

don't push your branches unless you want your teammates to be able to pull them down. Pull requests will still update your map(?).


first: clone from github
    make a branch for what I'm working on 

checkout branch for what you're working on

do a git commit first from your branch with changes?
git merge master is to get any updates from github

database:
game state 

clues, characters in json file


use mlab to share database



make git files to ignore node modules
when you clone it down, npm i in root and client folders
